- Differentiate between **hot reload**, **hot refresh**, and **cold start** when running your Flutter app.
- Use **Containers** to build the structure of your appâ€™s UI.
- Arrange elements using **Columns** and **Rows** to create responsive designs.
- Incorporate **custom fonts** to personalize the look and feel of your app.
- Add and use **Material icons** to enhance your UI.
- Style **Text widgets** to create aesthetically pleasing text displays.
- Navigate and use the **Flutter Documentation** to find helpful resources and examples.

## Features
